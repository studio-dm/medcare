              <h3>Medicare Basics</h3>
              <p>This article was updated on: 01/01/2016</p>
              <p>Medicare is a federal program, managed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It provides health insurance to eligible United States citizens and permanent residents of five or more years.</p>
              <p>You’re eligible for Medicare if you’re 65 or older, or under 65 with certain disabilities. You may also qualify for Medicare, regardless of age, if you have end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease).</p>
              <h3>Medicare Overview</h3>
              <p>Medicare beneficiaries can generally get their health coverage in two ways: through Original Medicare, or through a private Medicare Advantage plan.</p>
              <p>Original Medicare comes in two parts:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Medicare Part A (hospital insurance):  This covers inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice, and home health care.</li>
                <li>Medicare Part B (medical insurance): This covers outpatient medical care, including (but not limited to) doctor visits, durable medical equipment, lab tests, and preventive services.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Certain types of Medicare coverage are only available through private insurance companies.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage): Medicare Advantage plans provide Original Medicare benefits through private insurance companies. There are many types of Medicare Advantage plans, such as Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plans. In addition to what’s covered under Original Medicare, some plans offer other benefits, such as routine dental and vision, health wellness programs, and prescription drug coverage.</li>
                <li>Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage): Original Medicare doesn’t include prescription drug benefits, except in certain situations. You can sign up for prescription drug coverage through a separate Medicare prescription drug plan, or through a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan.</li>
                <li>Medicare Supplent (Medigap): Medigap helps pay for out-of-pocket costs not covered in Original Medicare, such as copayments, coinsurance, deductibles, and overseas health coverage. These plans can only be used for Original Medicare and cannot be used with a Medicare Advantage plan.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you’re enrolled in, or will soon be eligible for Medicare, and are considering whether one of the Medicare plans could be a good option for you, we can help you compare your options. We're happy to walk you through your options by phone or email you information; you can request that using the links below. If you’d like to get personalized assistance, you can talk to a licensed insurance agent today.</p>

            <article class="col-xs-12 m-basics-a" id="m-basics-a">
              <h3>What is Medicare Part A coverage?</h3>
              <p>Medicare Part A is health insurance offered by the federal government to United States citizens, and legal immigrants who have permanently resided in the U.S. without a break for the 5-year period, who are age 65 and older and to some people under age 65 with certain disabilities. Together with Medicare Part B, it makes up what is known as Original Medicare. Part A helps pay for the cost of inpatient hospital care.</p>
              <p>Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) helps cover the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Inpatient hospital care:</strong> Includes semi-private rooms, meals, and nursing services for patients who were transferred from an acute-care hospital or were admitted to a long-term care hospital within 60 days of being discharged from an inpatient hospital stay.</li>
                <li><strong>Skilled nursing facility care:</strong> Includes semi-private room, meals, skilled nursing care, medications, medical supplies and equipment, and transportation for those whose doctor has decided that daily skilled care is medically necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Nursing home care:</strong> Included if deemed medically necessary, provided the beneficiary requires more than custodial care (help with daily living tasks, such as bathing, dressing, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>Hospice care:</strong> Includes doctor services, nursing care, medical equipment, medical supplies, and more for those who are terminally ill and are expected to have six months or less to live.</li>
                <li><strong>Home health services:</strong> Includes at-home skilled nursing care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and more when intermittent skilled nursing care or therapeutic services are medically necessary.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Medicare Part A cost-sharing amounts (for 2016) are listed below.</p>
              <p>Inpatient hospital:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Deductible: $1,288.00</li>
                <li>Coinsurance:
                  <ul>
                    <li>$322.00 a day for the 61st-90th days</li>
                    <li>$644.00 a day for the 91st-150th days (lifetime reserve days)</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Skilled nursing:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>$0 for days 1-20</li>
                <li>$157.50 a day for the 21st-100th days (Skilled Nursing Facility coinsurance)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you get benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board, you automatically get Medicare Part A starting the first day of the month you turn age 65. If you are under age 65 and disabled, you automatically get Part A after you get disability benefits from Social Security or certain disability benefits from the Railroad Retirement Board for 24 months. You will receive your Medicare card in the mail three months before your 65th birthday or your 25th month of disability. If you have ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also called Lou Gehrig’s disease), you automatically get Part A the month your disability benefits begin.<br>If you have end-stage renal disease (ESRD), you may be eligible for Medicare Part A. For details, contact Medicare in any of the following ways:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Go to medicare.gov.</li>
                <li>Call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048. Medicare representatives are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Most people will not have to pay a monthly premium for Medicare Part A, provided you or your spouse paid Medicare taxes for a minimum of ten years while working. If you are not eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A, you may voluntarily enroll in Part A if you meet the following conditions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>You are 65 or older, and you are entitled to (or enrolling in) Medicare Part B, and meet the citizenship or residency requirements.</li>
                <li>You are under age 65, disabled, and your premium-free Medicare Part A coverage ended because you returned to work.</li>
                <li>You have not paid Medicare taxes through your employment.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you or your spouse worked and paid Medicare taxes for less than ten years, it will still be taken into consideration by the Social Security Administration when the Medicare Part A premium amount is assessed; therefore the premium amount may be reduced the longer you or your spouse worked and paid taxes. You may be subject to a late enrollment penalty if you do not enroll in Medicare Part A when you are first eligible to do so. If you do not automatically qualify for Medicare Part A, you will be given an Initial Enrollment Period that starts three months before you turn 65, includes the month you turn 65, and lasts for three additional months after you turn 65. When voluntary enrollment takes place more than 12 months after a person’s initial enrollment period, a 10 percent penalty is assessed for 2 years for every year he or she could have enrolled and failed to enroll in Part A.<br>Of course, this is just the start of what Medicare benefits are available. The plan that may work for you depends on your medical needs, budget, and other factors.</p>

            <article class="col-xs-12 m-basics-b" id="m-basics-b">
              <h3>What is Medicare Part B coverage?</h3>
              <p>Medicare Part B (medical insurance) covers medically necessary services and supplies needed for the diagnosis or treatment of your health condition. This includes outpatient services received at a hospital, doctor’s office, clinic, or other health facility. Medicare Part B also covers many preventive services to prevent illness or detect them at an early stage. Together, Medicare Part A and Part B are known as Original Medicare.</p>
              <h4>Medicare Part B benefits</h4>
              <p>Medical services and supplies covered by Medicare Part B include (but may not be limited to):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Doctor’s visits</li>
                <li>Laboratory tests and X-rays</li>
                <li>Emergency ambulance services</li>
                <li>Mental health services</li>
                <li>Durable medical equipment</li>
                <li>Preventive services, such as pap tests, flu shots, and screenings</li>
                <li>Rehabilitative services, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Medicare Part B costs</h4>
              <p>You’ll pay both a monthly premium and a yearly deductible for Medicare Part B. <strong>In 2016, most people will pay $121.80 for their monthly premium</strong> and $166 for the yearly deductible. You may have to pay a higher premium if your income is above a certain amount. If you didn’t enroll in Medicare Part B when you were first eligible, you may have to pay a late-enrollment penalty, unless you’re eligible for a Special Enrollment Period.</p>
              <p>For individual services and supplies, your Medicare Part B costs will vary. Some preventive services are completely covered if your provider accepts Medicare assignment. If the Medicare Part B deductible applies, you must pay all costs until you meet the yearly deductible amount before Medicare begins paying its share.</p>
              <p>After your deductible is met, you typically pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for the service. You may also owe a copayment for certain outpatient services.</p>
              <p>Did you know that some Medicare Advantage plans may offer additional services beyond Medicare Part B? For example, some Medicare Advantage plans include benefits like wellness programs and routine vision and dental benefits. These benefits aren’t normally covered by Medicare Part A or Part B.</p>

            <article class="col-xs-12 m-basics-c" id="m-basics-c">
              <h3>What is Medicare Part C, or Medicare Advantage?</h3>
              <p>Medicare Advantage plans are sometimes referred to as Medicare Part C. They are Medicare-approved private health insurance plans for individuals enrolled in Original Medicare, Part A and Part B. When you join a Medicare Advantage plan, you are still in the Medicare program and must continue paying your Part B premium.</p>
              <p>Medicare Advantage plans provide all of your <a href="">Medicare Part A (hospital insurance)</a> and <a href="">Medicare Part B (medical insurance)</a> coverage. They generally offer additional benefits, such as vision, dental, and hearing, and many include prescription drug coverage. These plans often have networks, which mean you may have to see certain doctors and go to certain hospitals in the plan’s network to get care.</p>
              <p>Medicare Advantage plans may potentially save you money because out-of-pocket costs in these plans can be lower than with Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, in some cases. Pricing will vary by plan provider, so it’s worthwhile to compare all plans in your area. Your costs will vary by the services you use and the type of plan you purchase. Each Medicare Advantage plan can charge different out-of-pocket costs and have different rules for how you get services (like whether you need a referral to see a specialist or can use only doctors, facilities, or suppliers in the network).</p>
              <h4>Plan options can include:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)</li>
                <li>Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)</li>
                <li>Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS)</li>
                <li>Special Needs Plans (SNPs)</li>
                <li>HMO Point-of-Service (HMOPOS)</li>
                <li>Medical Savings Account (MSA)</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>You can generally join if:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>You live in the service area of the plan you want to join.</li>
                <li>You have Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, coverage.</li>
                <li>You don’t have end-stage renal disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant); however, there are a few exceptions.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Choose your plan carefully. Outside of when you first become eligible to enroll and other personal circumstances that may qualify you for a Special Election Period, you are only able to change plans once a year during the Annual Election Period. The Annual Election Period lasts from October 15 through December 7 of each year.</p>
              <p>There is also a Medicare Advantage Disenrollment Period, which runs from January 1 through February 14. During this time, individuals enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan can disenroll from their plan and return to Original Medicare coverage.</p>
              <p>If you’re enrolled in, or will soon be eligible for Medicare, and are considering whether one of the Medicare plans could be a good option for you, we can help you compare your options. We're happy to walk you through your options by phone or email you information; you can request that using the links below.

            <article class="col-xs-12 m-basics-d" id="m-basics-d">
              <h3>What is Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage?</h3>
              <p>As a Medicare beneficiary, you don’t automatically get prescription drug coverage. This Medicare Part D coverage is optional, but can be valuable if you take medications. If you don’t sign up when you’re first eligible, you might have to pay a late enrollment penalty if you decide to enroll later.</p>
              <p>Many people are automatically enrolled in Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, when they reach 65 years of age or have certain disabilities. But Original Medicare doesn’t cover your medications (except those you may receive as a hospital inpatient or, in some cases, outpatient).</p>
              <p>You can get Medicare prescription drug coverage in two different ways. Both of these are through private insurance companies that contract with Medicare.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Through a stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan—you can add this benefit to your Original Medicare coverage. You can enroll in any Part D prescription drug plan that serves the area where you live.</li>
                <li>Through a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan—you can get a Medicare Advantage (Part C) plan that includes drug coverage, so that you get all your Medicare benefits under one plan.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>When can I sign up for Medicare Part D coverage?</h4>
              <p>You don’t have to purchase Medicare Part D coverage. That decision will not affect the Original Medicare coverage you have, but it may be beneficial for you to enroll in a stand-alone prescription drug plan or a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan when you’re first eligible. If you choose to enroll later or go 63 days or more without drug coverage, you may have to pay a higher premium for prescription drug coverage, unless you can show that you had creditable drug coverage during the time you were not enrolled in Medicare Part D. Creditable drug coverage is coverage that pays at least as much as Medicare’s standard drug coverage.</p>
              <p>You must first have Medicare Part A or Part B to qualify for enrollment in a prescription drug plan and you must have both Medicare Part A and Part B to qualify for enrollment in a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan. The best time to sign up for Medicare prescription drug coverage is usually as soon as you’re enrolled in Original Medicare, during your Initial Enrollment Period (IEP).</p>
              <p>You can also sign up for Medicare Part D coverage during the Annual Election Period (sometimes called the “fall open enrollment season”), which runs from October 15 to December 7. During this time period, anyone with Medicare Part A and/or Part B can enroll in a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan or change from one prescription drug plan to another. You can also enroll in or switch Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans during this period.</p>
              <p>There are some situations that qualify you for a Special Election Period, when you can enroll in a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan or a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan outside of the Annual Election Period.</p>
              <h4>What’s the coverage gap, and how can I avoid it?</h4>
              <p>The coverage gap refers to the point when you and your prescription drug plan or Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan have spent a certain total amount on your prescriptions; at this point, you’ve reached your initial coverage limit. Now you’re in what’s known as the coverage gap, or “donut hole.” During this phase of your Part D benefits, you pay a higher portion of your prescription drug costs. After you’ve spent a certain amount, you’ll reach the catastrophic coverage phase, and you’ll pay only a small copayment or coinsurance for your medications for the rest of the year.</p>
              <p>There are a number of things you can do to help reduce your drug costs. For example:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Switch to lower-cost drugs. Talk to your doctor about using generic and/or over-the-counter drugs. Many generic drugs work as well as costly brand-name prescriptions, and this could save you money each year and keep you out of the coverage gap.</li>
                <li>Ask your plan about prescription mail-order programs. They can save you money on medications.</li>
                <li>Always use your Medicare drug plan membership card when you get your medications. When using your card, you may be able to get discounted rates on the drugs you buy, and any money spent on drugs automatically counts toward your deductible.</li>
                <li>Look for programs that offer assistance. The National Patient Advocate Foundation or the National Organization for Rare Disorders may have programs that can help with your drug costs. Comprehensive information about federal, state, and private assistance programs in your area is available from the National Council on Aging.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>What does Medicare Part D cost?</h4>
              <p>Your actual costs for prescription drug coverage vary depending on the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Prescriptions you use</li>
                <li>Prescription drug plan or Medicare Advantage Prescription drug plan you choose</li>
                <li>Whether you go to a pharmacy in your plan’s network</li>
                <li>Whether your drugs are on your plan’s formulary (drug list)</li>
                <li>Whether you get Extra Help paying your Medicare Part D costs</li>
              </ul>
              <p>One of the costs you should consider is your monthly premium. Most Medicare Part D stand-alone prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans charge a monthly premium that varies by plan, so you’ll be responsible for paying that premium. Please note that if you’re enrolled in a Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plan and are also enrolled in Medicare Part B, you must also continuing paying your <a href="">Medicare Part B premium</a>. And, if you’re enrolled in a <a href="">Medicare Advantage plan</a> (with or without prescription drug coverage), you must continue paying your Medicare Part B premium.</p>
              <p>In addition to your monthly premium, your costs for Medicare Part D coverage may include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                    An annual deductible: This is the amount you pay for your prescriptions before your prescription drug plan or Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan starts to share in the costs. Deductibles vary by plan, and it may be possible to find one with a $0 deductible amount.
                </li>
                <li>A copayment/coinsurance: This is the amount you pay out of pocket each time you buy a prescription. These costs can vary from plan to plan, and also vary depending on drug tiers and which stage of the benefit you are in at the time of purchase. Drugs in a higher tier tend to cost more than those in a lower tier.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Can I get payment help if my income is low?</h4>
              <p>Medicare offers a program called Low Income Subsidy, also known as Extra Help, for people with low incomes who qualify. If you are enrolled in Medicare Part D and have limited income and resources, you may automatically qualify for Low Income Subsidy. If you don’t automatically qualify for Low Income Subsidy, you may still apply and be determined to qualify for Extra Help from Medicare. If you do qualify, you’ll get help paying for your Medicare Part D costs, such as the premium, deductible, coverage gap, and cost sharing.</p>
              <p>You are deemed automatically eligible for Extra Help if you are in one of the following circumstances:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>You are entitled to Medicare and get full coverage from a state Medicaid program.</li>
                <li>You get help paying your Medicare premiums through a Medicare Savings Program</li>
                <li>You get Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you automatically qualify for Extra Help but don’t enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan yourself, Medicare will enroll you in a plan so that you’ll get help paying for your prescription drugs. (Medicare will send you a letter telling you when your coverage begins.) However, if you have certain retiree drug coverage from a former employer or union, Medicare will not automatically enroll you in a prescription drug plan. For more information, contact your local Social Security office, or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4228). TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048. You can talk to a customer service representative 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
              <p>If you’re enrolled in, or will soon be eligible for Medicare, and are considering whether one of the Medicare plans could be a good option for you, we can help you compare your options. We're happy to walk you through your options by phone or email you information; you can request that using the links below.

            <article class="col-xs-12 m-supplement" id="m-supplement">
              <h3>What Is a Medicare Supplement<br>(Medigap) Plan?</h3>
              <p>Original Medicare, Parts A and B, pays for many of your health-care services and supplies, but it doesn’t pay for everything. That’s why you may want to consider getting a Medicare Supplement insurance policy, also called Medigap. A Medigap policy is sold by private insurance companies. These plans help pay some of the hospital and medical costs that Original Medicare doesn’t cover, such as copayments, coinsurance, and yearly deductibles. Some Medigap policies also help pay for a few services that Original Medicare doesn’t cover. Basically, a Medigap policy fills the “gaps” in Original Medicare coverage.</p>
              <h4>How do Medigap policies work with Medicare?</h4>
              <p>Medigap policies supplement your Original Medicare benefits, which is why these policies are also called Medicare Supplement plans. If you have Original Medicare and a Medigap policy, Medicare will pay first, as your primary insurance, and your Medigap policy will fill in the cost gaps. For example, suppose you have a $5,000 ambulance bill and have not yet met the yearly Medicare Part B deductible. Medicare Part B will pay 80% of your ambulance bill, minus the deductible amount. The Medigap policy would then pay your remaining 20% coinsurance of your $5,000 ambulance bill. Some Medigap policies also pay the remainder of the Medicare Part B deductible you still owe.</p>
              <h4>Plans that don’t supplement Medicare coverage (aren’t Medigap policies)</h4>
              <p>It’s important to be aware of which plans are not supplements to your Original Medicare:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Medicare Advantage plans (like an HMO or PPO)</li>
                <li>Medicare prescription drug plans (Part D)</li>
                <li>Medicaid</li>
                <li>Employer’s or union’s plans</li>
                <li>TRICARE</li>
                <li>Veterans’ benefits</li>
                <li>Long-term care insurance policies</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>What benefits do Medigap policies cover?</h4>
              <p>Currently, there are 10 standardized Medigap plans, each represented by a letter (A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, N; there’s also a high-deductible Plan F). These are sold in most states (Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin each have their own different set of Medicare supplement plans). Coverage levels and premiums vary, but the benefits of each plan within a lettered category remain the same despite the insurance company or location. For example, Plan A benefits are the same in New Jersey as they are in Oregon.</p>
              <p>In general, Medigap policies cover the following benefits:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Medicare Part A coinsurance and hospital costs (up to an additional 365 days after Medicare benefits are used)</li>
                <li>Medicare Part B coinsurance or copayment*</li>
                <li>Blood (first 3 pints)*</li>
                <li>Part A hospice care coinsurance or copayment*</li>
              </ul>
              <p>(*Coverage may be partial for some plans.)</p>
              <p>Some types of Medigap policies also cover:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Skilled nursing facility care coinsurance</li>
                <li>Medicare Part A deductible</li>
                <li>Medicare Part B deductible</li>
                <li>Medicare Part B excess charges</li>
                <li>Foreign travel emergency</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For a quick look at the benefits provided by the standardized Medigap policies, please <a href="">view this Medigap Plan Benefits Chart.</a></p>
              <h4>What benefits are not covered by Medigap policies?</h4>
              <p>Medigap policies don’t cover the following health services and supplies:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Long-term care (care in a nursing home)</li>
                <li>Vision or dental care</li>
                <li>Hearing aids</li>
                <li>Eyeglasses</li>
                <li>Private-duty nursing</li>
                <li>Drugs</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>When's the best time to buy a Medigap policy?</h4>
              <p>The best time to buy a Medigap policy is during your Medigap Open Enrollment
                Period. This period lasts for 6 months and begins on the first day of the month
                in which you’re both 65 or older and enrolled in Medicare Part B. Some states
                have additional Open Enrollment Periods including those for people under
                65. During this period, an insurance company can’t use medical underwriting.
                This means the insurance company can’t do any of these because of your health
                problems:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Refuse to sell you any Medigap policy it offers</li>
                <li>Charge you more for a Medigap policy than they charge someone with no
health problems</li>
                <li>Make you wait for coverage to start (except as explained below)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>While the insurance company can’t make you wait for your coverage to start, it may
be able to make you wait for coverage related to a pre-existing condition.
A pre-existing condition is a health problem you have before the date a new
insurance policy starts. In some cases, the Medigap insurance company can
refuse to cover your out-of-pocket costs for these pre-existing health problems
for up to 6 months. This is called a “pre-existing condition waiting period.”
After 6 months, the Medigap policy will cover the pre-existing condition.</p>
              <h4>Additional facts about Medigap policies</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>You must have Medicare <a href="">Part area</a> and <a href="">Part B</a> to get a Medigap policy.</li>
                <li>Every Medigap policy must be clearly identified as “Medicare Supplement Insurance.”</li>
                <li>A Medigap policy can only cover one person, so if you are married, you and your spouse would need to buy separate policies.</li>
                <li>Not all types of Medigap policies may be available in your state.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Medicare Supplement (Medigap) Plan<br>Comparison Chart</h3>
              <p>The 10 different <a href="">Medicare Supplement (Medigap)</a> plans have standardized benefits across each plan letter. For example, Medigap Plan A will have the same benefits regardless of which state you live in or which insurance company you buy from. If you live in Massachusetts, Minnesota, or Wisconsin, the Medigap plans in these states are standardized differently.</p>
              <h4>How to read the chart:</h4>
              <p>If “100%” appears in a row on this chart, the Medigap policy covers 100% of the benefit. If a row lists a percentage, the Medicare Supplement policy covers that percentage of the benefit. If a blank space appears in a row, the policy doesn’t cover that benefit.</p>
              <img src="img/chart.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
              <p>*Plan F is also available in a high-deductible version. With the high-deductible Plan F, you pay for all Medicare-covered costs until you reach the deductible of $2,180 in 2015 before your Medigap plan pays anything.</p>
              <p>**Plan N pays 100% of the Medicare Part B coinsurance. There are a few exceptions: Certain office visits may require a copayment of up to $20; and emergency room visits that don’t result in your being admitted as an inpatient may require a copayment of up to $50.</p>
              <p>***Once you have reached the annual out-of-pocket spending limit and your Medicare Part B deductible, your Medigap plan pays 100% for Medicare-covered costs for the remainder of the calendar year.</p>
              <p>Keep in mind that because Medigap benefits are standardized, the main difference between plans of the same type is the cost.</p>
